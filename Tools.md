# Tools
This section will explain some of the tools that will make your life a little bit easier in an Azure environment, while not focused at attacking they will enable you to leverage GUIs and other tools to administer a system and access other resources.

- [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/#overview)
- [Azure Remote Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/user-documentation/connect-windows-7-10)

I'll add more as I find them and equally encourage suggestions.
